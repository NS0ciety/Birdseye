Birdseye is a tool designed to scrape information about a user from social media accounts such as Facebook & Twitter.
Birdseye uses an sqlite database to save gathered information allowing you to create a database of your scraped users.

FEATURES:  
Facebook scraping  
Twitter scraping  
Instagram scraping (currently in development)  
Database handling to save/modify & delete users  

USAGE:  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
chmod +x birdseye.py  
./birdseye.py  

NOTE: Facebook uses techniques to try to block scraping attempts. This can be bypassed by using tools like Torghost to rotate your IP address.
