Birdseye is a tool designed to scrape information about a user from social media accounts such as Facebook & Twitter.
Birdseye uses an sqlite database to save gathered information allowing you to create a database of your scraped users.

FEATURES <br />
Facebook scraping <br />
Twitter scraping <br />
Instagram scraping (currently in development) <br />
Database handling to save/modify & delete users <br />

USAGE <br />
pip install -r requirements.txt <br />
chmod +x birdseye.py <br />
./birdseye.py <br />

NOTE: Facebook uses techniques to try to block scraping attempts. This can be bypassed by using tools like Torghost to rotate your IP address.
